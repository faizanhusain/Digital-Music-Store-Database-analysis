# Digital-Music-Store-Database-analysis
The Database contains the 11 tables such as album, customer, invoice, track, genre, etc., and this analysis covers various insightful queries on the music store database, about Senior-most employee, Country with most invoices, Top three invoices by total, City with the best customer and Rock music listeners
Let's break down each of the queries in the SQL script to explain what accomplished.
1. Senior-most Employee- This query fetches the details of the senior-most employee based on their job title level (levels). By sorting the employees in descending order (order by levels desc), the query ensures that the employee with the highest level appears first, and limit 1 restricts the result to only one employee.
2. Country with Most Invoices- This query counts the number of invoices (count(*)) grouped by each billing_country. The results are then sorted by the count in descending order (order by c desc), meaning the country with the highest number of invoices will appear at the top. This shows which country generates the most revenue in terms of invoices.
3. Top Three Invoices by Total- The query lists the top three invoices based on their total value. Sorting by total desc ensures the highest values appear first, and limit 3 restricts the output to only the top three results. This helps identify the largest purchases.
4. City with the Best Customers (Based on Total Spending)- This query aggregates the total invoice amount for each city (sum(total)), then groups the results by billing_city. The cities are ordered by total invoice value in descending order, showing which cities have the best customers in terms of overall spending.
5. Best Customer (Highest Total Spending)- This query identifies the best customer by calculating the total amount they have spent (sum(invoice.total)) across all their invoices. The join operation connects the customer table with the invoice table based on customer_id. After grouping by each customer and sorting by total amount spent (order by total desc), it returns the top customer who has spent the most (limit 1).
6. Rock Music Listeners- This query retrieves the email, first name, and last name of all customers who have purchased "Rock" music. It joins the customer, invoice, invoice_line, track, and genre tables to filter by genre.name = 'Rock'. The distinct keyword ensures that duplicate entries are not included, so only unique Rock music listeners are listed.
